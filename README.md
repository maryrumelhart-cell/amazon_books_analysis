**üìä Project Overview**


This analysis examines the top 50 bestselling books on Amazon for each year from 2009 to 2019, investigating how ratings, pricing, and reader engagement evolved across the decade. The dataset includes 550 unique books from 248 authors across both fiction and non-fiction genres.

***Research Questions:***

‚Ä¢ How do book ratings, prices, and review volumes change over time?

‚Ä¢ Are there differences between fiction and non-fiction bestsellers?

‚Ä¢ What correlations exist between price, ratings, and reader engagement?

‚Ä¢ Can we predict book success from these metrics?


**üîç Key Findings**


***Rating Trends:***

Bestseller ratings remained exceptionally high and stable, averaging 4.62 stars across all 550 books. Notably, ratings improved by 0.16 points from 2009 to 2019, suggesting that customer expectations for top books have increased over the decade.

***Price Dynamics:***

Average book prices declined significantly from approximately $18.42 in 2009 to $13.10 by 2019‚Äîa reduction of $5.32. Despite this decline, 12.4% of bestsellers were premium titles exceeding $20. Interestingly, price showed only a weak negative correlation with ratings (-0.133), indicating that higher prices don't guarantee better reviews among bestsellers.

***Reader Engagement:***

The most reviewed book was "Where the Crawdads Sing" by Delia Owels with 87,841 reviews and a 4.80 rating. On average, bestsellers received 11,953 reviews. However, review volume showed minimal correlation with ratings (-0.002), suggesting that popularity in terms of volume doesn't necessarily mean higher quality ratings.

***Genre Comparison:***

Both fiction and non-fiction achieved strong bestseller status. Fiction books (43.6% of the dataset) averaged 4.65 stars and 15,684 reviews but at lower prices ($10.85 average). Non-fiction titles (56.4%) averaged 4.60 stars with 9,065 reviews at higher prices ($14.84 average).

**üìä Analysis Sections**


***Exploratory Data Analysis:*** 
Distribution of ratings, prices, and reviews with summary statistics and data quality checks.

***Temporal Trends:*** 
Year-over-year changes in average ratings, prices, and review counts to identify long-term market shifts.

Statistical comparison between fiction and non-fiction bestsellers across all metrics.

***Correlation Analysis:*** 
Relationship mapping between price-rating, review volume-rating, and time-based trends.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitations**


***Sample Bias:*** 
This analysis only includes bestselling books, not representative of the broader publishing market.

***Platform-Specific:*** 
Amazon data only; trends may differ on other retail platforms.

***Time Period:*** 
Data spans 2009-2019; the publishing market has evolved since then, particularly post-2020 with digital expansion.

***Genre Simplicity:*** 
Categorization limited to Fiction/Non-Fiction, missing granular sub-genre insights.
